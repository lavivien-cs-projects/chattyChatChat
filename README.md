# Chatty Chat Chat 

## Decription

In this assignment you will implement your very own internet chat protocol -- the ChattyChatChat protocol (CCC). The protocol governs how a single ChattyChatChat server mediates connections between any number of ChattyChatChat clients as they communicate with each other.

Implementing this protocol will require that you create at least two Java classes:
- The ChattyChatChatServer, which is run on a single computer at a specified port and receives connections from clients.
- The ChattyChatChatClient, which is run by each client computer and connects to the server.

## Specification

Your implementation of the ChattyChatChat protocol requires that you write two programs -- a ChattyChatChat server and a ChattyChatChat client.

### ChattyChatChatServer

The server program must be a class named ChattyChatChatServer; this program should accept a single command-line argument describing the port for the server to listen on. For example, to start the server and have it listen to port 9876, the command-line invocation would be:
```
java ChattyChatChatServer 9876
```
A single instance of the ChattyChatChat server will server as the common point of connection for all clients wanting to interact with the chat server.

### ChattyChatChatClient

The client program must be a class named ChattyChatChatClient; this program should accept two command-line arguments describing the server name and port to connect to. For example, to start a client and connect to a server running on port 9876 on cs-class, the command-line invocation would be:
```
java ChattyChatChatClient cs-class.uis.georgetown.edu 9876
```
Note that the server must be running in order for any client to successfully connect.

### chat protocol and commands

The communication protocol for the chat clients and server should obey the following rules:
- A "normal" message is text sent by one client to the server; this message should be relayed to all other clients, who will print it to standard out (e.g., using System.out.println()) upon receipt.

- The CCC protocol also provides the following chat commands which should be interpreted by the server to perform a special task:
	- /nick <name> : Set this client's nickname to be the string <name>. For example:
	```	
	/nick cosc150student
	```
	would set the user's nickname to cosc150student.

	- The nickname command may be used more than once per session by any user; the current nickname is retained unless/until a subsequent /nick command is received.
	- Nicknames do not need to be unique on the server.
	- Nicknames are single-words and do not contain spaces.
	- Any additional characters beyond the first word may be ignored; that is, the above and below commands would have identical effect:
	```	
	/nick cosc150student these words may be discarded
	```
	- /dm <name> <msg> : Send a message to user(s) with the specified nickname. For example:
	```	
	/dm cosc150student This is a "secret" message
	```
	should deliver the message "This is a "secret" message" only to user(s) who have the nickname "cosc150student".

	- Only clients with the correct nickname should receive this message; nothing should be sent to any other clients.
	- If no client has the specified nickname, this message may be ignored.
	- If multiple clients have the specified nickname, all of them should receive the message.
	- /quit : Disconnect from the server and end the client program.
		- When a client enters this message, it should still be sent to the server as a notice that the client will disconnect; the server may then safely close this socket connection and clean-up details related to the client.
		- The client program should disconnect, clean up, and end when this string is entered.
		- Any additional characters after the /quit may be safely ignored.
- Any other input (including one beginning with a slash, but not exactly matching the above) should be considered a regular message.
